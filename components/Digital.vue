      <p id="S1" class="descrip2"><b>Stephen Mcmennamy</b> splices together photographs of wildly unrelated objects to form new, exciting images. Mcmennamy calls these creations “combophotos.”  These perfect images go far beyond just using Photoshop. He meticulously photographs each part of the image before slicing them together.</p>

      <p id="E1" class="descrip5"><b>Erik Johansson</b> is a photographer who depicts surreal imagery. With the camera as his main tool, he strives to capture the impossible. None of the finished photos he creates use computer-generated imagery; they are all a combination of photos he has taken himself. Because it takes a great deal of time to create one photo, he might only complete six to eight finished pieces a year.</p>
      <img class="sara" src="sara.jpg">
      <p id="S1" class="descrip6"><b>Sara Ludy</b> The work by Sara Ludy comes in the form of sculptures, websites, videos, animations, and audio-visual experiences. Her works seek to find the relationship between the virtual and physical world. In some of her most recent work, she explores the world of virtual reality.</p>
